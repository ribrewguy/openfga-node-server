/**
 * Static migration bundle — used by both the production migrate CLI
 * (`src/cli/migrate.ts`) and the SQLite smoke tests
 * (`tests/unit/storage-tuples-idempotency.test.ts`).
 *
 * Why this exists: Kysely's `FileMigrationProvider` does a dynamic
 * `import()` on each migration file. Under tsx (the production CLI
 * entry point) those .ts files resolve fine, but under vitest's
 * runtime the dynamic-import chain can't follow the migrations'
 * internal `'../src/storage/db'` relative imports because the
 * migrations folder is outside the test include scope. Static
 * imports go through vite's transform layer in both runtimes, so
 * this bundle works everywhere.
 *
 * Order matters — the keys (timestamps) sort lexicographically into
 * the same order as the on-disk filenames the legacy
 * `FileMigrationProvider` would have discovered.
