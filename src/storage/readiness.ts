/**
 * Engine-agnostic readiness check used by `GET /ready`.
 *
 * Distinguishes two failure modes operators care about:
 *
 *   - `db_unreachable` — the readiness query itself threw. Network,
 *     auth, DSN, or driver-level problem.
 *   - `schema_missing` — the query succeeded but at least one of the
 *     core namespaced tables is absent. Operator forgot to run
 *     migrations, or `OPENFGA_DB_NAMESPACE` points at an empty schema.
 *
 * `kysely_migration` is included in the core set on purpose — its
 * absence is the cleanest signal that no migration has ever run
 * against the configured namespace, which is the common production
 * misconfiguration this probe was added to catch.
 *
 * The probe uses one round-trip per call — Postgres `to_regclass(text)`
 * over the four qualified names; SQLite `sqlite_master` `IN`-list. Both
 * are catalog lookups so the readiness path never contends with
 * application traffic for connections beyond a single short query.
